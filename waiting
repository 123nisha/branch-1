Curled on my bed
I feel cold and numb
For hours
I just lay here
Silent
In reverie
Waiting
Waiting for something
I don't know
Or perhaps I'm lying
Even to myself
Why I am sad
Why my eyes are puffy
But I can't accept this truth
My ego is crushed
Along with my heart
The moon is looking down on me
Through a gap on a window
Bathing me with it's forlorn light
Empty and alone
I curled once more.
Waiting
Waiting for day break.
